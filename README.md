# Final-Project

What I learned:
  I learned a lot about collisions and how to make a never ending cycle that changes the farther in you are

What I got stuck on:
  I got really stuck on changing the position of platforms after it hit the end of the screen.
  
What would you like to improve?
  I'd really like to improve the the conciseness and over all readability of my code because I feel like it's all jumbled together

How would you do things differently next time?
  I would start with the platforms and generative process in the beginning instead of the end.

How far did you stray from the game design document?
  I wanted the platforms to go up and down ,but I couldn't make that feasible.

How did you stay on track?
  I was able to create a never ending cycle of platforms that change and increase difficulty.
